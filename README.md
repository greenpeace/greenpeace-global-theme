![Logo banner for this repository “Greenpeace Planet 4 Master Theme”](./screenshot.png)

## Introduction

### What is it?
This is a sample master Wordpress theme to be used for Greenpeace Planet4 project.
You can learn more about this project on [the planet4 blog](https://medium.com/planet4).

This theme is used in planet4 base [wordpress site](https://github.com/greenpeace/planet4-base).
This theme is based on the [`timber/starter-theme`](https://github.com/timber/starter-theme) codebase.
It has a correlated [sample child theme](https://github.com/greenpeace/greenpeace-planet4-child-theme).

## How to use this theme in planet4

You can use the theme in Wordpress directly.
It is already included as a dependency for planet4 base site in composer.json
```
"require": {
    ...
    "greenpeace/planet4-wordpress": "4.7.2",
    "greenpeace/planet4-master-theme" : "0.1.0",
    "greenpeace/planet4-child-theme" : "0.1.2",
    ...
},
```

By default the child theme is used but you can activate the master theme
by specifying it in `wp-cli.yml` like:
```
theme activate:
  - planet4-master-theme
```

You can then run `composer run-script theme:activate` to activate it.

## Development

### Pre-requisite

For development, you will require a couple of tools.

- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) version >= 6
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as npm client, front-end dependency manager
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) as PHP dependency manager

### Setup

0. Clone this repository
```
git clone git@github.com:greenpeace/planet4-master-theme.git && cd planet4-master-theme
```
1. You then need to install the dependencies:
```
npm install
composer install
```

The following packages will be installed as dependencies
- [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/)
- [Timber](https://timber.github.io/timber/)
- [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/) for automated CSS transformation

### Change the CSS

0. Link this project to your planet4 site to use this theme
```
cd /path/to/planet4-base/public/wp-content/themes
rm -rf planet4-master-theme
ln -s /path/to/planet4-master-theme .
```
1. Edit the CSS in src/css
2. Rebuild the main.css
```
yarn build
```
3. Test it on your local setup
4. If everything is fine, commit your changes
5. Tag your new version
```
git tag -a v0.x.x -m 'v0.x.x'
git push origin v0.x.x
```

### Add a new frontend library

0. Frontend dependencies are stored in `package.json`, handled by yarn. To add a new dependency, e.g. jquery, call:

```
yarn add jquery
```

1. Manually add the new required files to the list of "assets" inside `package.json`, then call gulp:

```
gulp assets
```

2. This will add these files to `assets/lib/`. Then open `functions.php` and add these new assets inside the `enqueue_public_assets` function:

```
wp_enqueue_script( 'jquery', $this->theme_dir . '/assets/lib/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js', array(), '3.3.1', true );
```
